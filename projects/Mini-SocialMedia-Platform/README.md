### Mini Social Networking Site

## Project Overview
    This project is a simple social networking platform that allows users to register, log in, create posts, and interact through likes and comments. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application simulates a mini social media site running entirely on the client-side. It provides a practical demonstration of how to implement front-end web development concepts such as user interactions, event handling, and dynamic DOM updates.
