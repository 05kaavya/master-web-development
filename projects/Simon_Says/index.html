            <p>
                Simon Says is a memory game where you have to follow the pattern of colors that the game shows you.
                <ul>
                    <li>The game will display a sequence of colors, starting with one and increasing as you progress through levels.</li>
                    <li>Watch the sequence carefully, and when it's your turn, click the buttons in the exact order of the colors shown.</li>
                    <li>If you get the sequence correct, you will move to the next level, and a new color will be added to the sequence.</li>
                    <li>If you make a mistake, the game is over and you can start again by pressing the start button.</li>
                    <li>Your score increases based on your level progression.</li>
                </ul>
